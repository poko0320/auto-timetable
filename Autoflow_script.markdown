# Autoflow Presentation Script
### Opening
* Hi there we are team [number], We're here to present AutoFlow, which is a tool that not only just help you build automation workflows, but also generates them for you. Simply describe what you want to automate, and AutoFlow creates the entire workflow automatically, connecting all related applications without writing a single line of code.

### Problem Statement
* Here's a scenario every university student knows too well: You want to meet friends next week. Sounds simple. But first - Open timetable app. Check class times. Open course website. Check assignment deadlines. Open calendar. Manually add the meetup. Cross your fingers you didn't forget anything. Next week you're with your friends when you get the notification 'Missed gym class.' You booked it. You paid for it. But you forgot it, because it was in yet another app you didn't check.
* AutoFlow solves this. Instead of opening five apps and hoping you didn't miss anything, you just say: 'Find me a time to meet with my friends next week.' AutoFlow instantly syncs your classes, assignments, bookings, and commitments across every platform, then suggests times that actually work.

### Preview of Autoflow
* So how does AutoFlow actually work? At its core, AutoFlow tackles repetitive tasks by breaking them down into automated stages. Think of it like building with LEGO blocks, except these blocks are smart, and they can even assemble themselves.
* Let me walk you through the interface. On the left, you'll see our workflow nodes. Each one represents a different action: fetching data from an API, processing files, querying databases, or even using AI to analyze information. 
* In the center is your canvas. This is where the magic happens. You can drag and drop nodes to build your workflow visually. Connect them together, and data flows automatically from one step to the next. It's intuitive, it's visual, and you can see exactly what's happening at each stage.
* But here's where it gets really powerful: See that AI Workflow Assistant on the right? Instead of building workflows manually, just describe what you need. The AI generates the entire workflow for you including nodes, connections, logic, everything in seconds.
* Once your workflow is ready, hit the 'Run Workflow' button at the top. AutoFlow executes each step automatically, and you can watch the results appear in real-time in the execution logs below.
* And because we want to maximize productivitiy, you can save, export, and import them anytime. Build once, automate forever.

### Deep Dive Demo
* Let me show you AutoFlow in action with a real-world demo. Imagine you are an AI enthusiasts who developed your own LLM, and you want to evaluate this model against a benchmark stored in a database. You decide utilize LLM as a judge to guide LLM score your model's response with a carefully crafted prompt. 
* With AutoFlow? [Show screen] I simply drag these nodes onto the canvas: a Database node to fetch my test cases, an LLM node configured with my judging prompt, some Logic nodes to handle the scoring, and a Code node to calculate final metrics. Connect them with edges to define the data flow, and... done..
* Hit the Run button, and watch. The workflow executes automaticallyâ€”pulling test cases, sending them to the LLM judge, collecting scores, and generating a comprehensive evaluation report. What would have taken hours of coding just ran in two minutes.
* The workflow can potentially be very customized based on user's need. For example, you can create a "ddos" system on yourself to force you quit gaming. The Autoflow keeps detecting for game running. Once it detects you start gaming, it displays memes on your screen to force you to quit and move on studying.

### Ending
* So how does AutoFlow address the theme of 'automate'? Here's the key insight: we not only just aims to automate tasks, but also to automate the creation of automation itself.
* Think about it. Traditional automation tools save you time on repetitive work. But building those automations? That's still manual, time-consuming, and requires technical expertise.
* AutoFlow breaks this paradox. We've automated the automation process. You don't configure workflows, you describe them. You don't debug connections, the AI builds them correctly. You don't waste hours on setup. You spend seconds on results.
* That's all about Autoflow, thank you for listening.
